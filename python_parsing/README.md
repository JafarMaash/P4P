    # split looks like ['IDENTIFIER', 'GOLEM', 'String=final \n']


to find out how spacy works google it 


I think you have to delete the csv each time you run the program


delete allidentifiers.txt, tosplit.txt, and csv_data.csv each time before you run the program

yes this is hacky

ewans example repo
https://github.com/ewantempero/JavaAnalyserCore/blob/main/JavaAnalyserCore/src/main/java/com/qualitascorpus/javaanalyser/demo/JavaParserModules.java

your test repos are like 

test_repos/open_source_app_v1.0/src

explain how final modifiers are tracked.

explain what tosplit does 

explain allidentifiers 

maybe explain flow of tester's actions
, + also flow of code kinda like stack trace + data structures involved

show example of what allidentifiers and tosplit look like 

we used to track what case conventions every repo followed, which youll see in the spreadsheet
virtually every repo was like 99% camel so we stopped.

tell them the 1-9 rules
